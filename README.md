# High-Dimensional-Computing

Emotion recognition is one of the most important functions to realise human-computer
interaction devices to achieve mutual sympathy between humans and machines.
The prime candidate for emotion recognition are the physiological signals. In order to make a
high quality machine learning model, it is necessary to train the model with a huge amount of
training data, thus making the computational complexity a major bottleneck.
To overcome this problem, hyperdimensional computing has evolved as a boon as it gives
better results even for very less amount of training data in comparison to other computing
paradigms .
As per the experimental results, HDC-MER (Hyperdimensional computing based Multimodality
emotion recognition) achieves higher classification accuracy for both valence and arousal .
On comparing this computing paradigm on two different platforms (CPU Vs Jetson AGX Xavier)
: Jetson gave better results than the former in terms of accuracy.
